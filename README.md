ZePortalPlugin
Are you tired of walking? Is the concept of "travel time" something you find quaint and unnecessary? Do you believe that the laws of physics are more like "general suggestions"? Then you've come to the right place.

ZePortalPlugin is for the server admin who looks at the vast, open world and thinks, "I could probably connect that mountain peak to my basement with an invisible hole in reality." This plugin lets you do what vanilla Minecraft is too scared to: create custom-sized, invisible portals that teleport unsuspecting players from literally anywhere to anywhere else.

What is this Sorcery?
Forget boring, noisy, purple rectangles that only go to one dimension. ZePortalPlugin allows you to designate any cuboid area—from a single block to a giant wall of nothing—as a one-way express ticket to a destination of your choice. It's clean, it's silent, and it's the most efficient way to get from Point A to Point B, provided you set it up correctly and don't accidentally aim it into lava.

Features
Custom-Sized Portals
Why settle for a boring 2x3 frame? Your portals can be any rectangular shape or size you can imagine. A doorway? A window? An entire wall? Sure, why not.

Point-to-Point Travel
Link your secret underground lair to the top of your friend's castle. Connect the spawn point directly to the shopping district. The possibilities are endless, and the potential for abuse is magnificent.

WorldEdit-Style Selection
The plugin uses the humble Wooden Axe, the universal symbol for "I am about to do something questionable to this landscape." It's intuitive, familiar, and appropriately understated for a tool that tears holes in spacetime.

Simple (Enough) Commands
A few straightforward commands are all that separate you from becoming a master of space and time. Mostly.

How to Bend Reality (A User Guide)
Creating a portal is a surprisingly simple four-step process.

Acquire the Tool of Power.
First, you need a Wooden Axe. Yes, wooden. We're manipulating the fabric of the universe here, show some class.

Define a Box of Air.
With the axe in hand, left-click a block to set the first corner of your portal. Then, go to the opposite corner and right-click another block. You have now selected a three-dimensional space. Try to look impressed.

Give It a Name.
Type the command /portal create <portal-name>. Give it a name you'll probably forget in five minutes, like shortcut_to_daves_place.

Weaponize It.
Go stand exactly where you want people to appear when they use the portal. For best results, don't stand inside a wall or over a pit of lava. Now, type /portal target <portal-name>. The portal is now armed and fully operational.

Anyone who now walks into the invisible box you defined will be instantly teleported to the target location. What could possibly go wrong?

The Arcane Incantations (Commands)
Permission: zeportal.admin (Because giving this power to everyone would be a terrible idea.)

Command	Description:

/portal create <name>	Claims the box of air you selected and gives it a fancy name.

/portal delete <name>	For when you inevitably create a portal to the void. Use this to clean up your mistakes.

/portal target <name>	Aims your portal at the block you're currently standing on.

/portal list	Lists all the reality-bending tears in spacetime you've created so far.

/setportal <name>	An alias for /portal create <name>.

/delportal <name>	An alias for /portal delete <name>.

/listportals	An alias for /portal list.

Installation (The Boring But Necessary Part)
Download the latest ZePortalPlugin.jar from the Releases page.

Place the .jar file into your server's /plugins directory.

Restart your server.

If the server doesn't crash, you've probably done it right. The plugin will create a portals.yml file to store all the magical gateways you create.
